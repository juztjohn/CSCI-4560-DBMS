# CSCI-4560-DBMS
Semester Project for Database Management Systems

We want to create a web-based health care portal that keeps patient records. 
Users will be given appropriate credentials to access and manipulate the patients information.

 - Front End: Elaina Vogel
 - Back End: Jaron McCutcheon
 - Tester/Merger: John Byrd

Our application will be written using a combination of django, MySQL, C#, and javascript.
The intent of this application is to ease the process of viewing and editing Medical Records for both the patient and medical faculty.
