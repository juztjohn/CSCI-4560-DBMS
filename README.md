# CSCI-4560-DBMS
[Github Repository](https://github.com/juztjohn/CSCI-4560-DBMS)

We will be creating a fully functional healthcare portal that allows patients and staff to access relevant information. Security and availability will be our main focuses of this project, as a real healthcare portal must be HIPAA compliant and highly available. 

We will be implementing security best practices such as role-based access and password hashing using the SHA256 algorithm and ensuring that the website and database is not prone to crashes or errors that may disrupt the user experience.
